# 🧩 Context receivers

**Coolest** Kotlin feature in 1.6.20 and 1.7

## Lots of use cases <br /> .grey[Cross-cutting concerns]

🪢 Dependency injection <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ❥ Nested configurations <br />
🧬 Detached interfaces <br />
⚡ Effect scopes <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ❥ Describing typed errors

---

# 📒 Logging

Prime example of .grey[cross-cutting concern]

--

- It's **never** part of the **main** domain
- If explicit, it pollutes the code
  - We want to **hide** any boilerplate around it
- Usually **re-used** across several domains or modules within the same application

---

# 📒 Logging

Prime example of .grey[cross-cutting concern]

```kotlin
interface Logger {
  suspend fun log(
    level: LogLevel, 
    subject: String, 
    message: String
  )
}
```

--

.smaller[Why `suspend` in `log`? If it may do I/O, I always add it]

---

# 🧩 Context receivers in use

1️⃣ Add to the signature where needed

.code70[
```kotlin
context(Logger)
suspend fun downloadData(url: URL): Info? =
```
]

--

2️⃣ The interface is available in the body

.code70[
```kotlin
  request(url).also {
    when(it) {
      null -> log(LogLevel.CRITICAL, ..., ...)
    }
  }?.let { parseInfo(it) }
```
]

---

# 🧩 Context receivers in use

3️⃣ You can call other functions with the same context without further boilerplate

.code70[
```kotlin
context(Logger)
suspend fun initializeApp(): App? {
  downloadData(App.DATA_URL)?.let {
    downloadAvatar(it.avatarImage)
  }
}
```
]

---

# 🧩 Context receivers in use

4️⃣ Inject — provide an impl. — using `with`

.code70[
```kotlin
class ConsoleLogger(): Logger { ... }

suspend fun main() {
  with(ConsoleLogger()) {
    config = initializeApp()
    ...
  }
}
```
]

---

# 📩 Implicit receivers

## What is `this`?

--

Answers the need of implicit supporting values

.code80[
```kotlin
class Database {             // ← dispatch
  context(Logger)            // ← context
  suspend fun User.save() {  // ← extension
    // if you need to refer to one
    this@Logger.log(...)
  }
}
```
]

---

# 📩 Implicit receivers

## What is `this`?

Answers the need of implicit supporting values

.code80[
```kotlin
class Database {             // ← dispatch
  context(Logger)            // ← context
  suspend fun User.save() {  // ← extension
    // in the body, this has type
    // Database & Logger & User
  }
}
```
]

---

# 📩 Implicit receivers

## What is `this`?

**Dispatch**: where the method is declared <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; non-existing for top-level functions

**Extension**: introduce with `fun Type.name(...)` <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; adds the ability to call with `.`

**Context**: extensions on steroids <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; values come from `with` <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; syntax with `.` not available

# 🪢 Dependency injection

# 🪢 Dependency injection

## .grey[Basic use case for context receivers]

.code70[
```kotlin
context(Logger, HttpService)
fun login(usr: String, pass: String): User? {
  ... // compute password hash
  val params = mapOf("username" to usr, 
                     "password" to hash)
  val r = httpPost("/login", params).getOrNull()
  return r?.let { result ->
    log(LogLevel.INFO, "login", "successful")
    parseUser(result)
  }
}
```
]

# 🪢 Dependency injection

## .grey[Basic use case for context receivers]

.margin-top[
🧶 Context declares the services you require <br />
🪡 `with` injects the values
]

Those two rules provide many benefits <br /> over dependency injection frameworks

---

# 🧶 Declare the services you require

The required services become part of the function signature with `context`

- The compiler can check good usage
- The IDE can help you diagnosing problems
- Explicit documentation about what the function may do

---

# 🧶 Declare the services you require

Some contexts may depend on others

.code70[
```kotlin
context(Logger)
class NetworkHttpService(): HttpService {
  ...
}
```
]

--

This imposes _ordering_ at injection time

.code70[
```kotlin
with(ConsoleLogger()) {
  with(NetworkHttpService()) { ... }
}
```
]

---

# 🪡 Inject the values using `with`

<br />

.font150[
**`with` is just regular Kotlin!**
]

This makes many patterns easier to achieve

---

# 🪡 Inject the values using `with`

## .grey[Hassle-free mocking]

.code70[
```kotlin
class AlwaysFails : NetworkHttpService {
  override suspend fun httpPost(url: URL) = null
}
```

Check your code without any actual connection

```kotlin
with(AlwaysFails()) {
  // test that things work when network is down
}
```
]

---

# 🪡 Inject the values using `with`

## .grey[Override part of a service]

We want to change the minimum logging level for some piece of code

--

.code60[
```kotlin
class OnlyImportantLogger(val logger: Logger): Logger {
  override suspend
  fun log(lvl: LogLevel, sb: String, msg: String) =
    when (lvl) {
      LogLevel.INFO, LogLevel.WARN -> { }
      else -> logger.log(lvl, sb, msg)
    }
}
```
]

---

# 🪡 Inject the values using `with`

## .grey[Override part of a service]

We want to change the minimum logging level for some piece of code

.code70[
```kotlin
context(Logger)
fun User.logOut() {
  ... // do the important stuff
  with(OnlyImportantLogger(this@Logger)) {
    ... // don't care if it fails
  }
}
```
]

---

# 🪡 Inject the values using `with`

## .grey[Combine services]

We often want to put some services together

- As a _module_, to alleviate boilerplate
- At the _initialization_ step in your app.
  - Based on some configuration

.code70[
```kotlin
data class AppModule(
  val logger: Logger, 
  val http: HttpService
)
```
]

---

]

.code80[
```kotlin
suspend fun main() {
  val app = initialize()
  with(app.logger, app.http, ...) {
    // do the job
  }
}
```
]

---

# 🪡 Inject the values using `with`

## .grey[Combine services] using delegation

.code70[
```kotlin
data class AppModule(
  val logger: Logger, 
  val http: HttpService
): Logger by logger, HttpService by http
```
]

--

.code70[
```kotlin
suspend fun main() {
  val app = initialize()
  with(app) {
    // do the job
  }
}
```
]

# 🪢 Context receivers

## .grey[Solve the nested configuration problem]

Boilerplate to handle services which depend on others, or not clear why it works

.margin-top[
- Services that depend on others declare so
  - The compiler _enforces_ the ordering
- No need to "extract" from a bigger context
  - Problematic with implicits / type classes
]

# 🧬 Detached interfaces

# &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .grey[Type Classes]

---

# ⚖️ Comparable classes

.font80[
> This interface imposes a total ordering on the objects of each class that implements it. This ordering is referred to as the class's _natural ordering_.
]

.code70[
```kotlin
interface Comparable<T> {
  fun compareTo(other: T): Int
}

fun <T: Comparable<T>> T.greaterThan(other: T) = 
  compareTo(other) > 0
```
]

--

1. What if you do **not control** the class?
2. Or there's **more than one** such ordering?

---

# 🧬 Detached interfaces

## .grey[Require `Comparable` as part of the context]

```kotlin
interface Comparable<T> {
  fun compareTo(one: T, other: T): Int
}

context(Comparable<T>)
fun <T> T.greaterThan(other: T) =
  compareTo(this, other) > 0
```

---

# 🎛️ Lack of control

.margin-top[
- New serialization format
- Different way to log things as strings
]

You cannot make `Boolean` implement those! <br /> (or any class you hadn't written)

--

.code70[
```kotlin
val booleanPretty = object : Pretty<Boolean> {
  override fun Boolean.pretty() = 
    if (this) "verdad" else "mentira"
}
```
]

---

# 🎛️ Lack of control

.code70[
```kotlin
val booleanPretty = object : Pretty<Boolean> {
  override fun Boolean.pretty() = 
    if (this) "verdad" else "mentira"
}
```
]

Annoying to use because of manual injection

.code70[
```kotlin
with (booleanPretty, intPretty) { ... }
```
]

--

Haskell and Scala provide special syntax <br />
Arrow developers are working on a solution!

---

# 🍱 There's more than one ordering

.code70[
```kotlin
fun <T : Comparable<T>> MutableList<T>.sort()
```
]

This cannot be re-used to sort

- ... backwards
- ... using a specific key

We are tied to the "natural" ordering

---

# 🧑‍⚖️ The Comparator

## .grey[There's more than one ordering]

```kotlin
// does it ring a bell?
interface Comparator<T> {
  fun compare(a: T, b: T): Int
}

fun <T> MutableList<T>.sortWith(
  comparator: Comparator<in T>
)
```

We end up duplicating each function!

---

# 🍱 There's more than one ordering

.code50[
```kotlin
interface Comparable<T> {
  fun compareTo(one: T, other: T): Int
}
```
]

.code70[
```kotlin
context(Comparable<T>)
fun <T> reversed() = object : Comparable<T> {
  override fun compareTo(one: T, other: T): Int =
    this@Comparable.compareTo(one, other)
}
```
]

--

Replace the ordering with the desired one

.code70[
```kotlin
with (reversed()) { list.sort() }
```
]

---

# 🧬 Detached interfaces

Useful for "adjectives" or "-ables"

- Detach the interface from the class
- Increased extensibility

Similar to type classes in Haskell <br /> and `given`s in Scala 3

.code65[
```kotlin
context(CoroutineScope) fun launch(
  context: CoroutineContext = ...,

`CoroutineScope` provides a _service_ or _effect_

- Creation and mgmt. of concurrent jobs

---

# 🧩 Summary

.grey[**Context receivers**] are awesome

🪢 _Dependency injection_ <br /> Checked by the compiler, easier modification

🧬 _Detached interfaces_ <br /> Enable new forms of extensibility

⚡ _Effect scopes_ <br /> Simpler than `Either`, with the same guarantees
